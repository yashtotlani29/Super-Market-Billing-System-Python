# Super-Market-Billing-System-Python
This project is a fully interactive Super Market Billing System developed in Python, designed to simulate a real-world checkout experience with precision and clarity. It allows users to input multiple items, calculate individual and total costs, apply dynamic discounts, and generate a clean, itemized receiptâ€”all within a console-based interface.
